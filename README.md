(Regarding the code, the messages that appear on the console are in Portuguese, the rest is in English.)

There were 6 exercises to do in the algorithm class.
We could use everything you've learned so far, which was:

# Variables (int, double, String, boolean, etc.)

# Control structures (if, else, switch)

# Cycles (for, while, do-while)

# Arrays

# Functions

# Basic APIs

# Libraries

# MultiDimensional Arrays/Collections

Ex1:
Banking System
The program simulates a simple banking system with a single account. Initially, the user must create an account by providing their name and an initial deposit. After creating the account, the user has access to a menu with four options: make deposits, make withdrawals, check the account balance and data, or exit the program. Each operation must be validated and the balance updated accordingly.

Ex2:
Grade Calculator
The program allows teachers to convert numerical grades into letters. The user enters the student's name and numerical grade, and the program converts it to the corresponding letter, providing personalized feedback based on the student's performance.

Ex3:
Shopping List Manager
The program helps the user manage a shopping list. The user can add several items to the list, each with a name and price. The program automatically calculates the totals, including taxes, and allows you to add more items up to a maximum of 10 products.

Ex4:
Text Analyzer
This program analyzes text entered by the user, providing detailed statistics about it. It performs basic analyses such as counting words and characters, as well as more complex analyses such as identifying specific words and their location in the text.

Ex5:
Guessing Game
This is an interactive game where the player tries to guess a random number. The player chooses a difficulty level which determines the range of possible numbers and the maximum number of attempts. The game provides hints after each attempt and keeps performance statistics.

Ex6:
Library System
This program simulates a library management system. It allows you to add books to the system (maximum 100), make loans and returns, search by different criteria and keep a record of all operations. The system must validate all operations and keep track of the stock of books.
